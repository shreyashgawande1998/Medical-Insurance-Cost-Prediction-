# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-
# Project Overview
So i have build a machine learning system that can predict what is the medical insurance cost of a person will be using some methods.
# Python Packages Used
Data Manipulation:Packages used for handling and importing dataset such as pandas, numpy and others. Data Visualization: Include packages which were used to plot graphs in the analysis or for understanding the ML modelling such as seaborn, matplotlib and others. Machine Learning: This includes packages that were used to generate the ML model such as scikit,etc.
# Source Data
I got these data from kaggle.
# Work Flow
:-Collect the data
:-Data analysis
:-Data pre-processing
:-Train-Test-Split
:-Model training
:-Model evaluation
# Results
So i got 75% on training and 74% on test data by using R Squared metric,so i have successfully build the predictive system which will predict the medical insurance cost of the person.
